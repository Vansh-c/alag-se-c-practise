this is my practise problems, I hope people who want to experiment and learn can find this and practise as much as they can. After practising this problems I have gained grip over loops ,
file handling, pointer , pointer functions , dynamic memory allocation. This list will be updated in future where I am also looking forward to add the program done using struct. 
I know this is very repetive, but by doing this I have done my best to do each sum in different ways
